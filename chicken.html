    <p>Chicken wings have become ubiquitous with sports and drinking culture, but they're well-worth your time (and
        appetite) on any occasion. They're simple, easy to cook, full of protein, budget-friendly and a fun, hearty
        finger food for parties and weeknight dinners alike. Try them baked, fried, smoked, grilled or made into soup.
        No matter how you eat chicken wings, they're a versatile, delicious .</p>
    <p>There are three types of wings you'll find at the market: the whole wing, the flat, and the drumette (the latter
        being the part that looks like a mini-drumstick). When you see these two parts together, it's easy to imagine
        the wing of a bird. Before the wing is broken apart, the drumette comes attached to the breast. Chicken wings
        also have a wing tip, but those aren't often included in sectioned-off bits of the cut.</p>
    <p>Chicken wings are white meat, even though they're juicier and have a more concentrated poultry flavor, like dark
        meat. Many people think of Buffalo wings when they think of this part of the chicken, and for good reason:
        they're extremely popular throughout the United States. The original Buffalo wings hail from Buffalo, New York,
        circa 1964: buttery, tangy, hot sauce-coated fried wings served with blue cheese dip and celery sticks.</p>
