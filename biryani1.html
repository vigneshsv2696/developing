    <h2>Hisory of biryani</h2>
    <p>A handi of biryani, with rice, meat (or vegetables), and spices, is a complete meal in itself. Be it a formal
        gathering or an informal meet among friends, a handi of biryani suffices. Each spoonful of this traditional dish
        is suffused with aromatic spices and rich flavors. Lovers of the dish swear by its distinctive taste. However, a
        key fact most biryani lovers donâ€™t know is that despite its various local varieties, the dish did not
        originate in India.
        The Indian subcontinent has a history of foreign rulers, with each ruler introducing the country to various
        cultures and traditions as well as cuisines. The Turks, Afghans, Persians, and Arabs have left behind a rich
        culture of foods and feasts, while the Europeans have introduced the country to the popular vegetables such as
        potatoes and tomatoes. Even the tea we swear by had been growing wild in the northeast until the Britishers
        started its commercial production. Staking the claim to fame loudest among all such dishes is biryani.
        Traditionally made as mutton and chicken biryani, the dish was introduced to the subcontinent by Arabs and
        Persians.
